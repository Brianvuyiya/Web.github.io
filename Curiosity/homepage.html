<p>   In the past few years there has been growing need of new ideas in the society that would help counter the challenges we have as a globe.
 As a country, we also need to move ahead in terms of technology. We need to consolidate our finest brains to think of ways in which we can improve
 in the field if science. The future of our growing world depends on those who can be able to think creatively and solve problems people long thought could not be solved.
 This website enables you an aspiring scientist or inventor to interact with other inventors and share your ideas. You can also further your own research by having a look at other people's ideas and inventions here in kenya.

    <h1>Embracing Scientific Thinking</h1>
    <p>
        On first glance this seems like a strange thing to say. How does one “embrace” scientific thinking? Furthermore, why would they? To answer these questions let’s first remind ourselves that innovation and improvement are the consequence of repeated cycles of experimentation, direct observation and learning... the scientific method. A relentless and systematic exploration of new ideas, including failures, enables us to constantly refine our understanding of reality.

        It’s also important to note what a principle is. The Shingo Institute defines “principle” as “a foundational rule that has an inevitable consequence.” If something is a principle, it is universal and timeless, it is discovered and understood rather than invented, at some level it is intuitive, and finally it is action-oriented and thus influences an outcome or consequence.</p>

    To embrace the principle of scientific thinking one believes deeply in the process of experimentation, is curious about “what if,” sets aside prejudices, and remains open to possibilities. The scientific thinker bases decisions and actions on facts and data as well as intuition and emotion. An organizational culture that embraces scientific thinking expects and supports people and teams at all levels to be “scientists,” passionately and relentlessly looking for and systematically trying new and better ways to do practically everything.
    <h1> Universal and timeless</h1>

    <p>Has there ever been a time when these behaviors in an organization or an individual did not produce breakthrough? Consider all of the major innovations and forward leaps in civilization made over eons. Were these not the attributes of great thinkers and scientists? Consider also the smothering conditions that existed during the Dark Ages in Western Europe when repression of thought and information led to large-scale stagnation of new insight. Cycles of societal refreshing and reformation always included people who have embraced scientific thinking. Scientific thinking is not isolated to a particular geography or ethnic background. Curiosity, systematic experimentation, and continuous learning are always the keys to significant breakthrough anywhere, any time.</p>
    <h1>Understood not invented</h1>

    <p>Scientific thinking is a natural law not an invention. No one invented or patented this process and then suddenly everything changed. Scientific thinking is a natural law or foundational rule that has always existed as a precursor to systemic and sustainable improvements of any kind. The more we understand and embrace the behaviors associated with scientific thinking the greater the rate, quality, and sustainability of improvements possible in any organization.</p>
    <h1>Principle-based behaviors</h1>

    <p> Failure to embrace the principle of scientific thinking results in stagnation and even repression of thought. People that work in a culture where scientific thinking is not embraced feel smothered, undervalued, unappreciated, and frustrated. Employee turnover is high. Innovation is slow and rarely sustainable. More nimble competitors end up with better products, at higher margins first to the market place.</p>

    Organizations with cultures and behaviors that flow from having embraced scientific thinking, attract and retain the best employees, create the greatest value for customers, define new markets, and provide the best returns for investors. Behaviors that reflect having embraced scientific thinking are closely connected with those of “seeking for perfection.” To embrace scientific thinking, a leader must have first enabled a culture of respect for every individual and be leading with humility. This is one of the reasons we refer to these two principles as cultural enablers.
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>It has been fascinating for me over the last 10 years as I've been trying to learn how to build these principles into the culture of an organization. Many misunderstand or think that by using plan-do-check-act (PDCA) or define, measure, analyze, improve, control (DMAIC) or some other approach to problem solving on the front line or for the administration of kaizen events, one has embraced scientific thinking. When compared to a deep culture, this is merely dabbling around the edges. When we selected the word “embrace,” we wanted to communicate that everyone in the organization has a deep respect and genuine appreciation for the behaviors that lead to a constant flow of questions, experimentation, analysis, learning, and change.

        Leaders create the environment, the example, and the expectation for this behavior. Managers enable it by establishing and managing daily work systems that require ideal behavior in all of their teams. Associates, every day, are thinking, wondering, asking, and learning. In a managed way, they are constantly experimenting, evaluating, recommending, engaging, and implementing the things they learn about how to make things better. Leaders and managers do the same but also ask about, go and see, recognize, and reward behaviors that demonstrate individual and organizational initiative to “embrace scientific thinking.”</p>
